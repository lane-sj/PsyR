# PsyR

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

PsyR computes confidence intervals for planned and post-hoc contrasts
from ANOVA models, including procedures described by Bird (2002) for
psychology research.

## Installation

You can install the development version of PsyR from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("garner-code/PsyR")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to obtain between subject
confidence intervals. All of the following examples will use the
post-hoc method (see Bird, 2002, for details on the post-hoc method):

``` r

## load relevant packages
library(emmeans)
library(afex)
library(PsyR)

# load some data
dat <- spacing

# set emmeans option to multivariate
afex_options(emmeans_model = "multivariate")

# perform the statistical model
mod <- aov_ez("subj", "yield", dat, within = "spacing", between = "group")

# define and mean-difference scale some between-group contrasts
emm_btwn <- emmeans(mod, "group")
raw_con_b <- list(
  "12vs34" = c(1, 1, -1, -1), # groups 1 & 2 vs groups 3 & 4
  "1vs2" = c(1, -1, 0, 0), # and so on...
  "3vs4" = c(0, 0, 1, -1)
)
con_b <- rescale_contrasts(raw_con_b, mode = "mean_difference")
btwn_con <- contrast(emm_btwn, con_b)

# feed the contrast table into psyci(); its family and participating factors
# are inferred from the model and the original emmGrid
psyci(model = mod, contrast_tables = list(btwn_con), method = "ph")

```

`psyci()` prints each result twice. The first table reports the contrast
effects and confidence intervals in the dependent variable’s original
units. The second reports the same values in sample standard-deviation
units, using the pooled within-cell scaling method from the original Psy
program. The raw tables remain available through ordinary list indexing.
For example:

``` r
result <- psyci(mod, list(btwn_con), method = "ph")
raw_table <- result[[1]]
scaled_table <- attr(result, "scaled_tables")[[1]]
attr(result, "scale_info")$divisor
```

The standard tables report `df_num = 1`, `df_error`, and Psy’s ordinary
observed contrast statistic in `F_value`. The `p_value` column is always
the unadjusted upper-tail probability from `F(1, df_error)`, so it
corresponds directly to the displayed statistic. `p_value_adjusted`
reports the probability from the selected simultaneous-inference
procedure, named explicitly in `p_adjustment`; this is the probability
commensurate with the reported confidence interval. For Bonferroni
output, for example, `p_value_adjusted = min(1, family_size * p_value)`.
The applicable family is recorded in the `psyr_family_group` and
`psyr_family_size` attributes and is also described in the printed
messages. The original `emmeans` `t.ratio` and `p.value` columns are not
retained. To print Psy’s legacy SS/df/MS/F layout for the supplied
contrasts and keep it with the result, use:

For direct checks in Psy’s probability calculator, Roy GCR tables attach
`psyr_probability_parameters = list(s, m, n)`. SMR tables attach
`psyr_probability_parameters = list(k, p, q, df)`, where `k` contains
one `sqrt(F_value)` per table row and `df` is PsyR’s error degrees of
freedom. Roy GCR tables also include a `theta` column equal to
`F_value / (df_error + F_value)`; this is the value entered into Psy’s
GCR field.

``` r
result <- psyci(
  mod,
  list(btwn_con),
  method = "ph",
  legacy_anova = TRUE
)
legacy_table <- attr(result, "legacy_anova_table")
raw_table[["df_error"]]
```

The legacy table is printed once, before the raw and standardized
confidence interval tables. It includes only supplied contrasts and
their applicable error rows; it does not create absent between-by-within
cross-products.

Here is an example, that carries on from the last, for obtaining within
subject confidence intervals:

``` r

# define and mean-difference scale some within-subject contrasts
emm_win <- emmeans(mod, "spacing")
raw_con_w <- list(
  "20vs40" = c(1, -1, 0),
  "20vs60" = c(1, 0, -1),
  "Quad" = c(1, -2, 1)
)
con_w <- rescale_contrasts(raw_con_w, mode = "mean_difference")
con_win <- contrast(emm_win, con_w)

# generate 95% CIs for the within subjects contrasts
psyci(model=mod, contrast_tables = list(con_win), method="ph")

```

For pairwise correlated within-subject means, PsyR also provides the
asymmetric noncentral-*t* standardized-effect interval proposed by
Algina and Keselman (2003). It is opt-in, so existing calls retain the
original Psy/Bird output. Use it with individual or Bonferroni
intervals:

``` r
result_ak <- psyci(
  mod,
  list(con_win),
  method = "bf",
  standardized_ci = "algina_keselman"
)
ak_table <- attr(result_ak, "scaled_tables")[[1]]
```

The new `algina_keselman_ci()` function also exposes the calculation
directly when an estimated contrast, its standard error, error degrees
of freedom, and the appropriate sample-SD scaling divisor are already
available.

And finally, here is an example of how to generate CIs for between x
within contrasts, using the same post-hoc method:

``` r

# get emms for each cell from the between x within design
emm_int <- emmeans(mod, c("group", "spacing"))

# emmeans forms products of the supplied between and within coefficients. It
# does not normalize those coefficients. Because con_b and con_w were each
# scaled above as order-0 mean differences, their products are correctly scaled
# order-1 interactions (differences between mean differences).

con_int <- contrast(emm_int, interaction=list(con_b, con_w))
# generate 95% CIs for the between x within subjects contrasts
psyci(model=mod, contrast_tables = list(con_int), method="ph")
